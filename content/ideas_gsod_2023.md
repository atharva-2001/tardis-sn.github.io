[Google Season of Docs](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs) provides support for open-source projects to improve their documentation and gives professional technical writers an opportunity to gain experience in open source.

TARDIS will be participating in Google Season of Docs this year. Project ideas are described below.

### Idea 1: Improve the Carsus Documentation
**Problem**: Carsus has organically grown over time and not much attention was paid to the documentation during development. The huge significance Carsus plays in TARDIS is still unknown to most of the user base and the poor attention given to it can be attributed to a lack of proper documentation about its usability and code. Improving the Carsus documentation can significantly impact the number of users TARDIS attracts each year.

**How would we measure success?**
- Improved documentation of various atomic sources and clarity on their significance and where they are used in TARDIS. 
- Instructions on updating atomic files in reference data repositories and using them for tests.
- Plenty of docstrings and comments in code, which would improve code readability. 

**What skills would a technical writer need to work on this project?**\
Python, Pandas, GitHub/Git, Sphinx and Software Documentation practices

**Volunteers**\
**@atharva-2001:** can help writers navigate through the code and answer their documentation problems

**Application Checklist:** 
- Familiarize yourself with TARDIS and Carsus by going through their documentation websites and quickstart notebooks. Build the existing documentation locally.
- Writers should go through these [guidelines](https://tardis-sn.github.io/gsoc_2023/guidelines/) and [requirements](https://tardis-sn.github.io/gsoc_2023/requirements/) before submitting an application.
- Send a [statement of interest](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs/tech-writer-statement) (please follow this template) describing (with examples) your previous technical writing experience showcasing the "skills required" indicated in each project. Choose only one project from the proposed projects below. You can send this to [tardis.supernova.code@gmail.com](mailto:tardis.supernova.code@gmail.com).
